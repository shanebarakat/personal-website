            PillThought, founded in September 2023, is a dynamic startup
            providing innovative web solutions for pharmacies, including apps,
            websites, and social media management. As COO, I spearheaded
            outreach efforts, took on a leadership role, and managed

            As the founder and lead event coordinator at Onyx Events, I successfully hosted two large-scale parties catering to students from the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University. My responsibilities encompassed managing ticket sales, overseeing event setup, coordinating equipment logistics, and executing targeted event marketing strategies. I was instrumental in venue planning, ensuring that each location was optimally prepared to accommodate the influx of attendees. Additionally, I worked closely with vendors and partners to secure the best deals and maintain a seamless event flow. My leadership and organizational skills were key in creating memorable and engaging experiences for all participants, solidifying Onyx Events' reputation for excellence in event coordination.

            As a developer, I recently participated in Block Hack Toronto 2024,
            a hackathon hosted by George Brown College. My team and I created
            "HoloFund," a charity app designed to ensure donations reach their
            intended causes. Built using Flutter for the
            front end, Python and
           Firebase for the backend, and
            Astrakode for blockchain integration, HoloFund
            assigns credibility scores to charities, providing donors with
            transparency and confidence that their contributions are making a
            real impact. This project earned us 2nd place overall and 2nd in the
            "Astrakode Decentralized Charity Blockchain Challenge". <br /><br />

            At StarterHacks, I developed "Spaces," a dynamic web app designed to help students find unique spots on campus for various needs, whether it's studying, relaxing, or even taking a quick nap. "Spaces" leverages a user-friendly interface to enable students to discover and share hidden gems around their university. Users can post their favorite spots, complete with descriptions and photos, and explore locations recommended by their peers. They can also like and comment on others' posts, fostering a sense of community and engagement. The app aims to enhance the campus experience by making it easier for students to find the perfect environment for their current mood or task. By encouraging user-generated content and peer recommendations, "Spaces" promotes a more connected and resourceful student body, helping everyone make the most out of their campus spaces. <br /><br />

            I built my portfolio website on VS CODE using
            HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript. First, I structured the
            website's content with HTML, creating sections for my bio, projects,
            and contact information. Next, I styled the site using CSS to ensure
            it was visually appealing and responsive across different devices. I
            used flexbox and grid layouts to organize the content efficiently.
            Finally, I enhanced the functionality with JavaScript, adding
            interactive elements such as a dynamic project gallery and a contact
            form with form validation. Visual Studio collaborative and user-friendly
            environment made it easy to develop and test my website in
            real-time. <br /><br />
